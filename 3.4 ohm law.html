                    A basic law regarding flow of currents was discovered by G.S. Ohm in
1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for flow of currents
was discovered. Imagine a conductor through which a current I is flowing
and let V be the potential difference between the ends of the conductor.
Then Ohm’s law states that,<br><br>
V ∝ I <br>
or, V = R I ----------> (3.3) <br><br>
where the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance of the conductor. The SI units of resistance is ohm, and is denoted by the symbol
Ω. The resistance R not only depends on the material of the conductor but also on the dimensions of the conductor. The dependence of R on the dimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows. <br><br>
<img class="content_img_right2" src="assets/images/fig-3.2.png" alt="">
Consider a conductor satisfying Eq. (3.3) to be in the form of a slab of length l and cross sectional area A [Fig. 3.2(a)]. Imagine placing two such identical slabs side by side [Fig. 3.2(b)], so that the length of the combination is 2l. The current flowing through the combination is the
same as that flowing through either of the slabs. If V is the potential difference across the ends of the first slab, then V is also the potential
difference across the ends of the second slab since the second slab is
identical to the first and the same current I flows through both. The potential difference across the ends of the
combination is clearly sum of the potential difference across the two individual slabs and hence equals 2V. The current through the combination is I and the resistance
of the combination RC is [from Eq. (3.3)],
<br><br>
 R<sub>c</sub>=2V/I=2R ----------> (3.4) <br><br>
since V/I = R, the resistance of either of the slabs. Thus, doubling the length of a conductor doubles the resistance. In general, then resistance is proportional to
length, <br><br>
R  ∝ l ----------> (3.5) <br><br>
Next, imagine dividing the slab into two by cutting it
lengthwise so that the slab can be considered as a
combination of two identical slabs of length l, but each
having a cross sectional area of A/2 [Fig. 3.2(c)].
For a given voltage V across the slab, if I is the current
through the entire slab, then clearly the current flowing
through each of the two half-slabs is I/2. Since the
potential difference across the ends of the half-slabs is V,
i.e., the same as across the full slab, the resistance of each
of the half-slabs R<sub>1</sub> is <br><br>

R<sub>1</sub> = V/(I/2) = 2V/I = 2R ----------> (3.6)
<br><br>

Thus, halving the area of the cross-section of a conductor doubles
the resistance. In general, then the resistance R is inversely proportional
to the cross-sectional area, <br><br>
R ∝ 1/A ----------> (3.7) <br><br>
Combining Eqs. (3.5) and (3.7), we have <br><br>
R ∝ l/A ----------> (3.8) <br><br>
and hence for a given conductor

R = ρ l/A ----------> (3.9) <br><br>

where the constant of proportionality ρ depends on the material of the
conductor but not on its dimensions. ρ is called resistivity.
Using the last equation, Ohm’s law reads <br><br>
V = I × R = Iρl/A ----------> (3.10) <br><br>
Current per unit area (taken normal to the current), I/A, is called
current density and is denoted by j. The SI units of the current density
are A/m<sup>2</sup>
. Further, if E is the magnitude of uniform electric field in the
conductor whose length is l, then the potential difference V across its
ends is El. Using these, the last equation reads
<br> <br>
El = jρl <br>
or, E = jρ ----------> (3.11) <br><br>
The above relation for magnitudes E and j can indeed be cast in a
vector form. The current density, (which we have defined as the current
through unit area normal to the current) is also directed along E, and is
also a vector j (≡ j E/E). Thus, the last equation can be written as,
<br><br>
 E = jρ ----------> (3.12) <br>
or, j = σE ----------> (3.13) <br><br>
where σ ≡1/ρ is called the conductivity. Ohm’s law is often stated in an
equivalent form, Eq. (3.13) in addition to Eq.(3.3). In the next section, we
will try to understand the origin of the Ohm’s law as arising from the
characteristics of the drift of electrons.
